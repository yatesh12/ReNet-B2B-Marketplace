### UI and UX Guidelines
- Use a component-first approach and document components with Storybook.  
- Follow atomic design: atoms, molecules, organisms.  
- Prioritize clarity: concise labels, visible affordances for vendor actions, clear error and success feedback.  
- Provide keyboard-first interactions and ARIA attributes for interactive controls.  
- Ensure mobile-first layouts and touch target sizes.

---

### Vendor Dashboard Highlights
- **Product Management** create, edit, delete, and bulk import CSV.  
- **Inventory Controls** set thresholds, automatic low-stock notifications, and manual stock adjustments.  
- **Order Workflow** view order statuses, accept/decline orders, and generate invoices.  
- **Analytics** sales summary, top-selling SKUs, and inventory turnover charts.  
- **Access Controls** vendor roles and permission boundaries.

---

### CI CD and Deployment
- GitHub Actions pipeline: lint -> test -> build -> deploy.  
- Recommended hosting: Vercel, Netlify, or static site on S3 + CloudFront for production.  
- Use environment-specific configurations and secret management for API keys.
